| Project Title               | A discussion platform encouraging engaging meaningful interaction around current affairs and their applicable thought experiments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Project Description         | I plan to construct a platform that allows participants to subscribe to daily sms-based discussions with people in their area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Precedents                  | Design methods for text-based natural language interactions. Peer-to-peer self moderation principles in centralised environments. Routing text in a centralised environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Outcomes                    | A Raspberry Pi SMS server that connects and routes SMS's between subscribed users with the perception of group communication without direct connection to other users. Functionality will include: User subscription/unsubscription to service, random group formation, sms routing between group members, web crawling for discussion content, community based moderation and user vetting. The final outcome will ideally be a schematic for the raspberry pi, including fully encapsulated code and instructions on device setup. |
| Strengths/Opportunities     | Potential for constructive discussion if userbase is localised and moderated correctly. Currently text messaging services are free on most phone services, and very accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Research Involved           | Raspberry Pi cellular shield and messaging API needs to be learned. Need to model the potential usage and the stress it may cause to the system. Current network routing methods can be easily translated to text messaging, need to consider the best way to store a routing table for persistent users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Learning Involved           | Mostly stated above, Python programming may need a polish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Work Involved               | Design Research, Python Code for backend, Raspberry Pi and Cellular shield assembly, ethical considerations and protocol design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| What I Can't Do             | All of this seems reasonable if I don't have to code an API for the cellular shield as most are only optimised for data and not SMS. If this is the case I can pivot to a web-based design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| How Will I Address Criteria | Demonstrate a functioning hardware and software solution, as well as a web platform to support installation of device in the users own space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Weaknesses / Threats        | Need to develop some degree of conceptual clarity, the idea doesn't have super strong foundations. This could be achieved through performing some design research and confirming or denying assumptions I have made until this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
